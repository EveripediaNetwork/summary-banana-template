  "prompt": "Tron is a decentralized, blockchain-based, open-source protocol supporting various kinds of blockchain networks and smart contract systems including bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Qtum, and other public blockchain smart contracts TRON features a delegated proof-of-stake(DPoS) principles as its consensus algorithm and a cryptocurrency native to the system, known as Tronix (TRX). Tron was established in March 2014 by Justin Sun and since 2017 it has been overseen and supervised by the a non-profit 'TRON Foundation' organization in Singapore which was established in the same year. TRX is the mainnet native token of the TRON protocol issued by TRON DAO which is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet blockchain technology and DApps. TRX is the basic unit of accounts on the TRON blockchain. TRX is also a natural medium currency for all TRC-based tokens. TRX connects the whole TRON ecosystem with abundant application scenarios that power transactions and applications on the chain. TRX was originally an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, but switched its protocol to its own blockchain in 2018. TRC20 has a fee of 5 Tron per 1 USDT coin for the transfer. Overview History 2017 The TRON Foundation was established in July 2017 in Singapore. TRON was founded by Justin Sun in September 2017. The Foundation raised $70 million in 2017 through an initial coin offering before China outlawed the digital tokens. 2018 The blockchain Explorer 'testnet', and Web Wallet were all launched in March 2018. TRON Mainnet launched shortly afterward in May 2018 marking the Odyssey 2.0 release as a key technical milestone for TRON. In June 2018, TRON switched its protocol from an ERC-20 token on top of Ethereum to an independent peer-to-peer network. In July 2018, the TRON Foundation announced it had finished the acquisition of BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file-sharing service. With this, TRON declared its independence with the creation of the Genesis block.",
